<h1>SUJITH</h1>
<p>I am a passionate Engineer with a degree in computer science & engineering. My very first experience with code was at the time when I started my own blog. My struggle to customize the blog pages introduced me to HTML & CSS. Sooner, the excitment of having the power to structure pages on my own sounded amazing and thatâ€™s when I decided to purse Web development.

Recently, I learnt Full Stack Development. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Java, C++ and Data Structures. Rational thought process and goal-oriented planning are my strengths.

I am currently on the look out for a challenging role to build products that make a difference.
